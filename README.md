### Charlie Schworer - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I’m Charlie! I have a professional background in Payroll, Accounting, and Finance. I recently obtained my Master’s degree in Data Analytics. My experience in managing financial data and ensuring accurate payroll processing has given me a strong foundation in data accuracy, compliance, and analysis. Now, I’m excited to pivot into the field of data analytics and apply my skills in a more technical and insights-driven capacity.

Throughout my career, I’ve developed a detail-oriented mindset and a deep appreciation for working with data. My transition into data analytics has allowed me to build on this by learning tools like SQL, Python, R, and Tableau, and applying them to real-world datasets to extract insights and support data-driven decisions. 


This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics/Data Science related material.
